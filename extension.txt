The problem our extension solves is determining if two friends can be connected 
in some way through mutual friends.  The data set consists of pairs of numbers 
which represent the friends.  We solved this problem by creating a graph with 
an unordered_map which included the friend number as the key and a pointer
to the node/friend as its value.  After we load in all of the friends
that are in the data set, we call finding which uses DFS to search for 
the end friend.  Each level that is traversed will increment the height
in order to figure out the number of connections for the search.  We tested it 
using the big data set that we download and we created a smaller data set to
make sure it all worked. It gives you the amount of friends if you used DFS
not the optimal one. Thus, the amount of connections it prints out tells you
there are X amount of connections or less. It will show that there is at least
some sort of connection between the two friends. 

The smaller data set we created is called smallCases.tsv and a list of pairs
that can be tested is in extPairs.tsv.
